# 🅿️ Smart Parking System using Computer Vision

A Computer Vision based Smart Parking System that detects free and occupied parking spaces in real-time from video feeds using Python and OpenCV.

This project helps in monitoring parking availability automatically and can be used in smart cities, malls, offices, and parking management systems.

---

## 📌 Features

- Detects free and occupied parking slots in real time  
- Uses image processing instead of physical sensors  
- Shows live parking availability count  
- Highlights:
  - 🟩 Green → Free parking space  
  - 🟥 Red → Occupied parking space  
- Works on video feeds (CCTV or recorded footage)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- cvzone  
- Pickle  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The parking area image is loaded.
2. Parking slot positions are marked manually using ParkingSpacePicker.py.
3. The video is processed frame by frame.
4. Each parking slot is analyzed using pixel intensity.
5. If pixel count is low → Slot is free.
6. If pixel count is high → Slot is occupied.
7. The system displays the result in real time.
